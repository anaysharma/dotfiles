## polybar config

I yoinked this config from Archcraft's Forest theme and edited a bit, all credits to Archcraft's creator.
to use it, backup your existing config, then copy /polybar folder's content in ```$HOME/.config/polybar``` directory, then run ```launch.sh```.


## Note
adjust font size according to your liking, i set them pretty small because of low res display.
